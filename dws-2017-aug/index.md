## A11y and performance testing with Chrome 60

by [Jon Haslett](https://twitter.com/jonathanhaslett)


## Chrome 60 & Lighthouse

With Chrome 60 moving to a stable release the audit panel in DevTools has been replaced with a new system powered by Google's [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) project.

Lighthouse is a Chrome Extension, a command line tool, and can also be run as part of a build system using a Node module.

Now it's baked into the Chrome DevTools workflow and more useful than ever.

## Four Default Audits


### Progressive Web App

Automated test for Google's minimum requirements for [PWA](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/checklist).


### Performance

Will depreciate PageSpeed Insights which has already had [Mobile-Friendly Test](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly) spun out.


### Accessibility
No longer need a separate [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/accessibility-developer-t/fpkknkljclfencbdbgkenhalefipecmb?hl=en) to run programatic accessibility tests.


### Best Practices
A series of tests that are best practice but don't fall under the other categories.
