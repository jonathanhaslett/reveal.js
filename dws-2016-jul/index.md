##Developer friendly <br/>accessibility testing

##The A11y Project

*"For many web developers, accessibility is complex and somewhat difficult. The Accessibility Project understands that and we want to help to make web accessibility easier for front end developers to implement."*

## Use these. Seriously. Do it.

* [Chrome Accessibility Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/accessibility-developer-t/fpkknkljclfencbdbgkenhalefipecmb?hl=en)
* [Node.js Terminal Accessibility Developer Tools](https://github.com/addyosmani/a11y)
* [Chrome Color Contrast Analyzer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/color-contrast-analyzer/dagdlcijhfbmgkjokkjicnnfimlebcll/related)


## [Chrome Accessibility Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/accessibility-developer-t/fpkknkljclfencbdbgkenhalefipecmb?hl=en)

This extension will add an Accessibility audit, and an Accessibility sidebar pane in the Elements tab, to your Chrome Developer Tools.

* Console output, just like any other front end debuging

* Able to perform tests that previously needed subjective user testing

* Accessiility properties when inspecting elements

## [Terminal Accessibility Developer Tools (A11y)](https://github.com/addyosmani/a11y)

* Based on the same Chrome Accessibility Tools

* Runs entirely in cli/terminal using Node.js (local JavaScript runtime) and PhantonJS (headless webkit based browser)

* Outputs to terminal or to a text file

* Useful for integration into customised front end build systems

[(Show Demo)](https://github.com/addyosmani/a11y)


## [Chrome Color Contrast Analyzer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/color-contrast-analyzer/dagdlcijhfbmgkjokkjicnnfimlebcll/related)

A Chrome extension to analyse a web page or portion of a web page for conformance with WCAG 2.0 Color Contrast requirements.

* Choose WCAG 2.0 Level and contrast requirements

* Scans the page and highlights contrast edges that comply with the required level

[(Show Demo)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/color-contrast-analyzer/dagdlcijhfbmgkjokkjicnnfimlebcll/related)


## Conclusion

Making accessibility the responsibility of of every front end developer and integrating testing into an early stage of the development workflow can save a lot of time and produces better outcomes for all web development projects.
