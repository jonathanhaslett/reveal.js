## Mobile vs. Tablet & Desktop

Desktop vs Mobile Market Share Worldwide (Jan 2017)

* In November 2016, global mobile usage passed tablet and desktop usage for the first time since the web began.

* Globally, the mobile user experience is now the primary user experience.

* When making decisions, filter by region or collect your own usage data with a tool such as Google Analytics when possible.

* We see very different numbers when we compare [India](http://gs.statcounter.com/platform-market-share/desktop-mobile/india#monthly-201701-201701-bar) with [Australia](http://gs.statcounter.com/platform-market-share/desktop-mobile/australia#monthly-201701-201701-bar).



## What does it mean?

The collapse in marketshare for IE 8/9/10 aggressively moves the web forward as a platform. 

Moving forward, every major desktop, tablet, and mobile browser platform can be considered an auto-updating "evergreen" platform.


## The future is now

Here's a few of the many features that designers and developers can finally use in the real world after dropping support for IE 8/9.

* viewport units (vw, vh) - [stats](http://caniuse.com/#search=vw)
* **picture** element - [stats](http://caniuse.com/#search=picture%20element)
* **srcset** attribute - [stats](http://caniuse.com/#search=srcset) - [demo](https://codepen.io/bradfrost/pen/fcltn) - [demo](https://codepen.io/Kseso/pen/AHBnJ)

## Collecting your own data

* [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/analytics/#?modal_active=none) records browser version and mobile/tablet/desktop stats

* [caniuse.com](http://caniuse.com) will import data from your Google Analytics account to show feature support for your specific users



## Conclusion

2016 was a great year for the web as a platform. Features that we've been talking about for years are finally here and ready for real world use. By properly collecting and analysing user data you can make informed decisions and start using many of latest features of the web platform today.
