## Getting started with GitHub Pages

by [Jon Haslett](https://twitter.com/jonathanhaslett)


## What even is GitHub Pages?

A free service provided by GitHub where you can create/host static websites based on the content of a repository hosted at GitHub.


## There are (broadly) three different ways to use GitHub Pages

* A nicer way to present your readme file or project documentation ([this](https://github.com/jonathanhaslett/PrivacyPi) vs [this](http://privacypi.io))

* Display a full static website built with HTML/CSS/JS (no server side programming)

* Use the static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) with [GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/) to create, generate, and host a [static site](https://davidwalsh.name/introduction-static-site-generators).


## A nicer way to present your readme file or project documentation

GitHub pages will automatically turn your readme.md or project documentation into a user friendly.

## Display your own custom static website built with HTML/CSS/JS

Serve any old HTML/CSS/JS based website with files stored in the *master* branch or *gh-pages* branch.

**That's exactly how this presentation is working right now.**

## Use the Jekyll to create, generate, and host a static site.


  *"Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through a converter (like Markdown) and our Liquid renderer, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server. Jekyll also happens to be the engine behind GitHub Pages, which means you can use Jekyll to host your project's page, blog, or website from GitHub's servers for free."*

  [Jekyll Docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/)


With GH pages. Rather than deploying or uploading your compiled output static page, GitHub will compile your static site from your repository.  

* Working with Jekyll itself is a whole different can of worms that requires a presentation of it's own.

* When GitHub takes a readme file or other project documentation and generates a site using one of the pre-built themes, it's actually using Jekyll to do so.

## What does it mean?

The collapse in marketshare for IE 8/9/10 aggressively moves the web forward as a platform.

Moving forward, every major desktop, tablet, and mobile browser platform can be considered an auto-updating "evergreen" platform.
